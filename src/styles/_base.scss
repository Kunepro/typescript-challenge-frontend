// instead or repeating the class in every file, we can define it globally and then
// overwrite with custom implementations in the component level.
// We can still keep the mixin in the global scope, in case we want to use it for something else, even though we could just add the class to a component template, this makes it a bit more intuitive how to overwrite partials of a mixin
